# Pardot Integration Starter Pack (PISP)

This app shows the art of the possible when integrating with Pardot. It allows you to send Leads to Pardot as Prospects as well as add those Leads to segmentation lists.

Creating segmentation is done via Flow and External Services
Creating prospect with segmentation info is done via Apex callout; that is executed from the same Flow
